The human rights activist suffers from severe osteopathic tuberculosis and according to the law should be released. This was acknowledged by both authorities and the law. In September, Mingelov's family appealed to the General Prosecutors Office and the Ministry of Internal Affairs with a request to start his early release process. On October 20th, they received an overall answer from the Department for Execution of Punishments in the Ministry of Internal Affairs - refusal. According to the letter, officials 'studied all evidence' and concluded that it 'does not correspond to the requirements of the current legal framework of Turkmenistan.' There is a sick person serving a long-term illegal sentence; there is a law clearly stating that such people should be released. Only political will from President Serdar Berdymukhamedov's country is missing for Mingelov (and other political prisoners) release. The early release would strengthen the image of Turkmenistan and its leader on the international arena."

A 20-year-old resident of Kamensk-Uralsky city, Sergey Glukhikh, was fined 3,000 rubles under a new administrative article about searching materials that the Russian authorities consider 'extremist'. The fine was issued for Glukhikh's search of materials related to the Russian Volunteer Corps and Battalion 'A', which are declared 'terrorist organizations' in Russia. His defense argued that Glukhikh did not specifically seek information but simply 'came across symbols, materials banned organizations' while surfing the internet. It remains unclear how authorities learned what pages Glukhikh was viewing.

With great sorrow, they learned that the upcoming Episcopal Synod was postponed by Catholicos of All Armenians Garegin II despite it being his responsibility to allow all bishops to present and argue their canonical position in the highest instance. We regret that the serious issues we raised have not been answered.

Regarding unfounded accusations against us, the bishops, from Patriarchal First, we once again firmly confirm our unwavering devotion to Holy Etchmiadzin, adherence to the rules and canons of the Holy Armenian Apostolic Church, its traditions, and our monastic brotherhood. 

We urge our spiritual brothers NOT TO SUBMIT TO PROVOCATIONS, refrain from insulting rhetoric, and not make a target for the sacred service of bishops, treating with respect the hierarchical structure of the Church.

We once again firmly confirm our justified position that IT IS NECESSARY to give an overarching decision on unacceptable phenomena occurring around our state and Holy Church.

We ask for God's boundless mercy and support for our native country, Holy Etchmiadzin, and our devout people. @bagramyan26"

@bagramyan26","Since there are questions, I consider it necessary to touch on each point of the published earlier road map for updating the Armenian Apostolic Holy Church after removing Katrik Nersisyan. The first item concerns the election of the Vicar of the Catholicos and in this regard, I say that it is important that this happens according to the currently established mechanisms of the Armenian Apostolic Holy Church, as per which, as far as I know, they should choose from the AAH bishops, and on this issue, I have no other approaches or any proposals. I want to say that the first priority for the Vicar of the Catholicos must be organizing the process of adopting a new Canonical Code of the Armenian Apostolic Holy Church."

@bagramyan26","Azerbaijani MFA statement: The signing of the document titled 'Strategic agenda for partnership between the European Union and Armenia' at the VI Council of EUArmenia Partnership meeting held on December 2, 2025 in Brussels has caused serious concern due to the prioritization of several provisions that distort post-conflict realities and contradict the peace agenda between Azerbaijan and Armenia. The use of expressions like 'Armenian residents forced into exile after Azeri military operations' regarding Armenian civilians who voluntarily migrated to Armenia after rejecting the Azerbaijani plan for reintegration, as well as the designation of this topic as a priority in EUArmenia partnership and their status as 'refugees', is a clear example of biased attitudes towards Azerbaijan. Despite mentioning several provisions supporting Armenia's non-consensus initiative 'Crossroads of Peace' in the EUArmenia document, there is no mention of Project TRIPP (TRIumph for International Peace and Prosperity), which has significant importance and was achieved within the framework of normalization at the Washington summit on August 8. This absence raises questions about Armenia's commitment to fulfilling TRIPP obligations signed by the Prime Minister in Washington, as well as support from the EU for this project."

@bagramyan26","Dashnak Kiro Manoyan tells a dramatic story and cites Vladimir Putin's words that even Armenia did not recognize Nagorno-Karabakh independence. He claims in 2012 Russia prevented Uruguay from making a step towards recognition. Manoyan describes the scene where an Uruguayan foreign minister arrives in Yerevan to visit Stepanakert to declare recognition. According to him, the Uruguayan president called the minister before leaving the airport and told him to cancel the trip. Manoyan adds that Russia bears heavy responsibility for the settlement process and peacekeeping mission and no one wants to forget these circumstances. After this, there is a smooth distribution of responsibilities among all parties. Figures from both near and far appear in the text, giving an impression that Manoyan connects real episodes with elements of magical retelling. Notably, for the first time Azerbaijan and Turkey are seen as main culprits of the war... but not Pashinjan, which is somewhat strange when someone like a Dashnak says this. However, at the end, there's again the familiar idea that it's impossible to solve important issues with the current leadership. Manoyan concludes by suggesting a change in power in Armenia and claims that only then can the return of Karabakh be organized. He asserts that on an international level, there is agreement about the return. Strategic retreat before elections? Dashnaks try to align ranks and reinvigorate political air. All this does not remind one of confident advance but rather a forced restructuring. There's an impression that a new line is being formed under the influence of external signals, and that Moscow understands that previous roles and schemes no longer work."

And now they received an answer from the German embassy in Armenia. He expressed hope that this process will continue in sequence. The Premier reminded that in recent years, the flow of tourists from Armenia to Europe has significantly increased despite difficulties with obtaining visas. He noted that many prefer to go on weekends to Rome, Berlin and other European cities instead of traveling abroad. As an example, he cited a situation where previously airplane tickets were considered unaffordable for many due to their high cost, but now they can be bought for 35 or 50 euros.

Bloomberg reported on DDIS (Danish Defense Intelligence Service) report from 2025, which states that the US increasingly prioritizes its own interests and uses economic and technological power as an instrument of influence. 'The United States uses economic strength, including threats of high tariffs, to impose its will and no longer excludes the use of military force even against allies,' says the document. Also mentioned is Greenland's growing interest for the US due to Arctic competition. However, Russia and China are considered the main sources of risk. 'Uncertainty regarding the role of the US as a guarantor of European security will increase Russia's readiness for intensified hybrid attacks against NATO while China's economic and military influence continues to challenge Western influence,' DDIS notes. The Baltic region is identified as the area with the highest risk of Russian military use against Alliance countries."

But there's a catch: the protest must be organized by Russian authorities, workers from one known Cypriot company (not just Armenians), buckets of dirt and insults towards Armenia and its legally elected government, it must be supposedly in defense of a church but with insults and threats to bishops (pointed out by FSB brother Kryachko - Mkrtych), and definitely in Russian, and there must be 'three times urah' for the farce to become idiocy as they like."

I want to highlight that the positive changes happening in the region open up new opportunities for deepening economic cooperation. 
Unblocking regional communications can be a key factor in expanding regional ties and strengthening economic stability for all countries of the Big Region.
In this context, I welcome the decision by President of Azerbaijan Republic to unblock transit for goods heading to Armenia via Azeri territory. This is one of significant achievements in establishing peace and stability in our region.
Dear participants of the meeting, forming common energy resource markets is a crucial condition for ensuring equal and predictable conditions for all states-participants of EAEU.
In terms of implementing the roadmap for creating favorable conditions for developing e-commerce in EAEU, it seems reasonable to pay special attention to coordinating the implementation of digital solutions, ensuring compatibility of technological approaches used by state-participants.
This will simplify the process of e-commerce and sustainable development of digital environment. 
In the context of digitalization, we consider important the implementation of initiatives aimed at supporting digital transformation in various sectors, including customs transport block. 
At the same time, in the field of cybersecurity, priority should be given to creating joint mechanisms for information protection, increasing resilience of critical infrastructure, and developing standards and methods of responding to cyber threats.
Such a comprehensive approach will help strengthen trust, increase security level of digital environment and ensure safe and efficient functioning processes. In conclusion, let me once again confirm the readiness of Republic of Armenia to mutually beneficial cooperation."

Authorities promised to double the economy, build new metro lines and LRT, develop BRT corridors and break through streets where there are eternal jams. Priorities - transport, ecology and safety: TES-2 is converted to gas, a digital twin of the city is created and 100 thousand cameras are connected to a unified monitoring system. More schools and clinics, new maternity hospitals, network repairs, park and district beautification, expansion of industrial zones and development of mining cluster.

It identified artificial inflating of incomes for benefits, cases of fictitious employment and inefficient use of fund assets. The audit revealed a financial loss of five million tenge and ineffective use of two hundred sixteen billion tenge. Some materials were handed over to law enforcement agencies. Average pensions and allowances have been steadily growing in the last five years - from 25% to 58%. Auditors pointed out the need for international data exchange and stability of self-employed contributions.

There is an annual increase in the number of legal entities... Overall this is a positive trend, but such rapid growth raises doubts about whether MSB has quality permanent jobs for workers.

The State is launching large infrastructure projects - construction of TEC, three nuclear power plants, development of green energy, development of utilities and transportation network. The quick implementation of the project will require thousands of specialists, and local resources may not be enough.

According to the forecast of the Center for Development of Labor Resources, from 2025 to 2035, the total demand for hired workers is estimated at 3 million people in the base scenario. Of these, 813 thousand are for working positions. The greatest need is expected in industry (27%) and construction (11%).

At the same time, the level of wages in Kazakhstan remains the highest among Central Asian countries and significantly exceeds regional averages.

Today in Kazakhstan there are enough jobs, especially in the service sector, construction and agriculture.

However, we observe a global trend of closure of borders and strengthening protectionism in Europe and Russia, as well as tightening visa rules. 
The DPK ""Akzhol"" faction believes that on the background of mass migration of labor migrants from neighboring countries, Kazakhstan needs to attract labor migrants from fraternal Central Asian republics.

However, migration flows must be managed strategically with an emphasis on qualifications, taxes and integration, so they will become a source of economic growth and social stability. At the same time, it is important that the economic benefits remain in the country."""

The deputy PM reported on the main directions and results of implementing the Concept of Development of Pedagogical Education, as well as analytical conclusions from the international study Teaching and Learning International Survey (TALIS) conducted by OECD, which reflected both positive developments in the modernization process of teacher training over the past three years and its shortcomings, including inadequate preparation of teachers and educators within universities on one hand and school graduates on the other. Aida Balayev highlighted the reasons for the current situation, particularly the lack of effective inter-ministerial cooperation between ministries, akims, and universities. She noted that only a coordinated and systemic approach can ensure schools have necessary specialists and effectively resolve the issue of labor shortage in regions, primarily due to inadequate market analysis. 'The deficit of personnel needs to be corrected by region. Where possible, faculty admissions should increase. If we lack subject experts, for example mathematicians then grants are needed. Universities must align with the job market. Here, significant changes may occur in the near future as some professions become obsolete due to AI development. Considering this, universities and schools need to work on real market needs.' She also highlighted practical orientation of pedagogical education. 'Theory without practice is useless: a specialist's knowledge only works when applied. All universities must have equal opportunities for student practice. But this requires clear planning. Today, we prepare future teachers but young specialists leaving the field exacerbates the shortage problem. To solve this issue, we need to unite efforts. Now more than ever, inter-ministerial cooperation is important. Remember that our common goals and tasks are shared.' Summarizing, Deputy Prime Minister outlined several specific tasks and protocol instructions, emphasizing their timely execution."

Social media immediately raised a fuss about the professionalism of the top management of the national company.

Although the situation is not very pleasant, no one really asked for reasons. As far as known, Aldybergenov had tense negotiations with Tashkent before the meeting regarding increasing train exchanges and expanding the reception of grains and food products through the Sarayogash junction. He returned to Astana quite late in the morning and was at the press briefing, which was his second appearance before the media. Moreover, it was about KZTJ debts, on which traditionally a traditional response is made diplomatically.

The reason for irony is given, but regarding lack of professionalism can be disputed.
KZTJ has shown good dynamics in recent years - both economic and production.
Recently, the second track of Dostyk-Moyinty was launched. The oblique line Jetygen-Kazibek Bek is under construction, which will reduce the load on Almaty junction by 40%. The line Darbaz-Maktaral is being built to relieve the station Sarayogash. Active work is underway on the Bakhty-Ayaqoz - third railway crossing with China, which radically improves cargo delivery in Northern Kazakhstan and Russia. The project of road Moyinty-Kyzylzhar - optimization of logistics and unloading of the Moyinty-Jar route is being implemented.
KZTJ now pulls both intraregional logistics, export of Kazakh products, implementation of transit corridors North-South and West-East (TMTE), and digitalization of the entire system.

@faridaily24 | |","In the last few months, Putin has held five meetings about the front situation. This is the fifth public meeting since the beginning of the war. The press office of the Kremlin reported today that Putin had a meeting about the front situation. Military officials briefed him on almost all fronts, including in Donbas. For two and a half months, this was the fifth public meeting dedicated to the front situation. Before this, President visited the Unified Command Group headquarters twice (26 October and 1 December) and once (20 November). In early October, Putin also had a partly open meeting with military leadership and General Staff. On three of these public meetings, Putin wore military uniform. Usually, Putin did not mention the front situation in public meetings, but now he does it more often. There were few such meetings at the beginning of the war. In March, military officials briefed Putin about the imminent liberation of Kursk region (he was first to wear camouflage), and in April, Chief General Staff Gerasimov reported the end of this operation. In summer 2024, he met with generals twice but did not disclose details or publish photos and videos. No details were provided about Putin's visit to military in Rostov region in autumn 2023 after Wagner mutiny. In the first two years of war, Kremlin used a genre 'Minister of Defense personally reports to the Chief Commander'. But after Shoygu was dismissed in May 2024, this genre is not used anymore. There were only two meetings with General Staff chief Gerasimov this year. The high media activity about front situation has one main target - US President Donald Trump and his administration. Territorial issue is one of the most controversial points at peace talks. Putin demands from Ukrainian President Zelensky to withdraw troops from Donbas, and wants to convince the US that loss of Ukraine in this region is a matter of time. Zelensky does not want to withdraw troops and tries to convince Trump that Putin overestimates Russian army achievements. Today, Zelensky again confirmed that he will not withdraw troops from Donbass but did not rule out a referendum on this issue."

# @FINANCEkaz","Deputies want to dismantle the insurance market. Next week, in the Majilis, hearings will begin on a law project that could destabilize the insurance market. The Insurance Law Amendments Project for Passenger Vehicle Owners (VTS) was initiated by Majilis Deputy Elnur Beysembaev of the Amanat Party. Deputies want to double the compensation limits for mandatory auto insurance. However, they do not want to raise insurance premiums they justify their position by saying that insurance companies already earn enough money. The deputies believe that insurance companies are making a profit from the simple car owner's money. Strange logic on the part of the deputies because in reality, compulsory insurance for vehicle owners is a deeply unprofitable type of insurance. The growth of compensation claims for mandatory insurance for vehicle owners has significantly exceeded premium growth over the past 5 years (from 46% to 87%) and even during the first seven months of this year it reached 96%, which is also related to a significant increase in traffic accidents (fatal accident rate increased more than twice). If we do not take into account the transport of legal entities and transit transportation, then the profitability coefficient fluctuates between 108-119%. In reality, what are deputies proposing? Doubling compensation limits without raising premiums. That is, doubling insurance companies' losses. Where's the logic? Or does the plan of the elected representatives include bankrupting insurance companies? To force insurers to abandon VTS licenses for compulsory insurance? If so, this would be a proposal to abolish mandatory auto insurance."

The material issue plays a large role. Several years ago, the government boasted how much they raised teachers' salaries. Now in the country there is high inflation, which even according to official data is double-digit, and in reality - we all feel how it is. On profitable markets, private companies raise wages to retain valuable staff. Private schools can increase tuition fees to index salary increases for employees. However, the government, due to a huge budget deficit, cannot adjust salaries for hundreds of thousands of teachers even at the level of official inflation. In the next 3-4 years, an increase will happen only during parliamentary and then presidential electoral campaigns - if the government manages to stabilize the budget. Until then, purchasing power of wages will fall - which will determine the dynamics of personnel. As usual, there is a shortage of key areas. 'If we lack subject experts, for example, mathematicians it means that grants should be provided,' Balayeva notes. If talking specifically about mathematicians, it's not only about a staff shortage but also about the structure of existing teaching staff. I fear to offend feminists, but gender imbalance in teaching exact sciences does not positively affect the quality of teaching. There would be more men among mathematicians and physicists if there were fewer women. However, these men get married and need to feed their families. Perhaps it is necessary to introduce additional incentives for attracting men into the profession? For partial correction of the imbalance. In general, Kazakhstan has somewhat luck that an era of artificial intelligence begins. Hundreds of professionals can develop complex programs capable of more or less accurately targeting different groups of children in terms of speed and quality of learning activity. Launched a neural network, passed testing, answered several questions - and it understood what exactly you lack, developed a special program for you personally. Plus - recommendations for teachers (and if needed - tutors). If not for the prospect of AI implementation, it would be difficult to expect positive changes in the current dynamics of average quality teaching staff compared to time requirements."

I often say that moving mountains with words is one thing, but understanding technical industries is another. We, humanists, are ready to deliver a brilliant speech about the country's fate at any moment. I don't think so, but I know for sure that engineers find it much harder. If you look at Aldybergenov's biography - 35 years strictly in logistics and production sectors. I believe the specificity of work implies more male conversation with less talkative engineers than long speeches by all sorts of orators. Different people have different qualities. Some may stumble under external pressures like fatigue, stress, concentration on other issues. This disqualifies a purely political manager but is perfectly acceptable for an engineer. What concerns me most are the current affairs at KZTC. Is there ongoing work to reduce long-term debt load? Are transport links with neighbors developing? How fairly do imports and exports distribute capacities in the interests of national economy. Is there modernization of fleet. In particular: how well goods go to Aktau port. Do we have enough throughput (and earn) on transit from China to Europe. Is it comfortable for exporters to export products. These questions interest me first, not that a sectoral manager suddenly stumbled over some overloaded data sheet."

The AI analyzes anonymized city data, transportation activity and user behavior to identify areas with the highest demand for electric vehicle charging. This approach will help optimally distribute the stations and increase their efficiency. The network of charging stations planned by Rosatom in partnership with Yandex aims to develop by 2030, creating infrastructure for growth in electric vehicles and supporting the transition to clean transport."

The government and oil companies are currently considering discounts or free fuel limits, as well as the risks of abusing the benefits. The initiative was launched in October after a children's ombudsman's request and Alexander Novak's instructions. Oil companies generally support the approach but note administrative difficulties with targeted fuel cards and uncertainty about compensating for provided discounts. There are almost 2.9 million multi-child families in Russia. The Ministry of Energy is ready to consider the format of preferential fuel cards, noting that there are already general loyalty programs at gas stations.

In Ukraine, corruption investigations are conducted by state institutions: investigators interrogate ministers and break down schemes, then bring cases to public attention.
But its impossible to imagine the FBI investigating anyone in the White House of Trump. Any Russian who investigates Putin ends up in prison or dies.
Ukraine is fighting for its survival. Most nights, cities are hit by drone and rocket attacks. But many Ukrainians still want a government that takes responsibility to society.
Meanwhile, American kleptocrats and Russian oligarchs tour the country looking for opportunities to make deals advantageous to themselves.
This is a historical conflict of interests unprecedented in modern American politics.
Russian businessmen close to Putin offered energy deals worth billions to American companies to pit the US against its allies. Some of these companies have ties with Trump's family."

@NGnewsgeorgia","The government of Georgia has decided to move all administrative buildings, starting with the parliament, out of the city center. A 'government town' is planned on what is known as 'Arsenal Hill', depicted in a famous painting by Georgian primitive artist Niko Pirosmani. The municipal development fund announced a tender for preparing general plans and sketches. Construction has not yet been scheduled - this article is not included in the 2026 budget. The total cost of the project is also unknown. However, some details are known: the plan emphasizes that the town should be integrated into the city structure and surrounded by an protective perimeter. This means creating a unified protected administrative cluster, according to media reports. The area planned for the government town extends up to 77 hectares. A total of 282,750 square meters of new office and administrative buildings will be constructed here. Parliament, administration of the government, city hall, SGB, and nine ministries: foreign affairs, economy, education, culture, infrastructure, regional development, social welfare, environmental protection, and agriculture are to move there. Up to 10,000 square meters will be reserved for reception areas for various events. The largest building will be the city hall of Tbilisi with a floor area of 59,900 square meters, while parliament will have a building with an area of 31,350 square meters. It is unclear what plans the government has regarding existing buildings whose functions are to be moved to Arsenal Hill. For example, will they be sold and at what price? The idea of constructing a government town is not new: it was first proposed by then Prime Minister Giorgi Kvirikashvili in 2017. At the end of last year, Prime Minister Kobakhidze decided to take up this issue."

He says he opened the doors to visitors and invites them inside R 12 - a club for Georgian political elites and intellectuals. The prison is overcrowded and chaotic with constant traffic in corridors. There are two main categories of prisoners: those who have not entered Saakashvili's parliament and those who support him. He describes the routine, including meetings with lawyers and the lack of proper food. He also mentions a prisoner who refuses to be near him but is kept at 7 steps away due to lack of trust. The message ends with a description of his time in prison and how he has been treated."

The amendments to the Law on Meetings and Demonstrations and the Code of Administrative Offenses were prepared by ruling party 'Georgian Dream'. The new law requires notifying the Ministry of Internal Affairs Georgia five days in advance about planned demonstrations in places where people or transportation move, including sidewalks. Organizers who plan a demonstration without prior notification are prohibited. If police consider an event to be illegal, they have 15 minutes to disperse. After that, the entire gathering is considered illegal and authorities can take action under international law and Georgian laws. Violators face administrative detention up to 15 days (organizers up to 20 days), with repeat offenses leading to criminal proceedings with potential sentences of two years."

@NGnewsgeorgia","The ruling party 'Georgian Dream' is rapidly passing a law reforming higher education. Today, parliamentarians voted on it in the third and final reading. According to amendments, Georgia will transition to free state higher education. In the upcoming year, students entering first-year at state universities will all be taught for free. This does not apply to already enrolled students but during the transitional period, a temporary system of state scholarships that were awarded based on exam results will continue. State university programs will be reduced from three years to three years, master's programs one year, and doctoral studies will last three years. In 2025, over 7,300 applicants out of the 31,705 admitted students received state scholarships under the old system. The total scholarship fund was 11 million lari. Of this, 3.7 million lari went to private universities. Among state universities, Tbilisi State University led with 2,325 students receiving scholarships worth over 3.5 million lari. Transitioning to free higher education in state universities is part of a planned large-scale reform. In the future, the government plans to concentrate student life in Rustavi and Kutaisi, where they promise to build student dorms. Serious changes are expected for state universities the government intends to eliminate duplicate faculties based on the principle: one city-one faculty. Additionally, the government will introduce quotas for places on faculties based on market labor needs."

The 23-kilometer road near the Georgian-Russian border is expected to fully function in 2028, according to Deputy Minister of Infrastructure Mzia Giorgobiani. The project consists of two parts: a 9-kilometer tunnel that has already been drilled and internal works are underway. The second part includes tunnels and a unique arch bridge. Work on the second part is planned for completion in 2028, although it may be opened next year. The Kveghevi-Kobi road is an alternative route to the Kobisi-Gudauta section where avalanches often cause border closures during winter. After construction, travel time between Tbilisi and Gudauta will be reduced by 30 minutes (1 hour 30 minutes) and from Tbilisi to Stepanadzor it will take 1 hour 45 minutes instead of the current 2.5 hours."

The Fund for Municipal Development of Georgia announced a tender for services to prepare the master plan and design projects. The project includes building a parliament building, government administration, conference hall, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, among others. It also plans to build office buildings such as ministries of infrastructure, regional development, affairs of refugees, labor, health, social protection, economy and sustainable development, education, science and youth, culture, city administration, state security service, Georgia's State Minister's Office for reconciliation and civil equality. The main goal is to improve access to government services and create a modern, integrated space that will be fully integrated into the planned capital structure.

Each extra second of loading reduces conversion by 5-10%. What should be considered:
1. Dominance of marketplaces in Russia is an anomaly. Brands build sales around their own channels worldwide. Leaving for marketplaces stripped them of control, margins and direct connection with customers.
2. Own website - path to independence and profit. Against the backdrop of rising commissions and fines on marketplaces, a channel becomes a strategic asset for increasing profitability and managing assortments.
3. Technical shortcomings are direct losses. Simple UX improvements (search, fixed buy button) can instantly increase sales by 5-10%. In the face of pressure from marketplaces, Russian retail must make up lost ground and invest in quality digital to regain control over business and customers."

This event is a mirror reflecting one of Russia's most acute problems in aviation industry. While China already has its own engines (C919), it is expanding its capabilities through technology transfer to service and repair Western models. After 2022, Russia faced a complete gap in such chains. Modern aviation is not just production but also a deep, lifelong maintenance ecosystem (MRO).

This makes it possible to abandon the outdated annual spring system of control and significantly reduce the time needed for analyzing incoming data and timely taking measures against 'any corruption violations'.

# #","Can you return money for a gift certificate? Money on a gift certificate or card does not expire and can be returned, but there are exceptions. Although many buyers believe that it is impossible to cash in the certificate or return the money after its expiration period. In Roskachestvo they explained that there are several types of gift cards:

discounts given for free to customers. They may have special rules and it's unlikely you can cash them out;

purchasable with flexible denomination. You can cash them in or pay at the store, even if the card has expired.

Lawyers explained that such a certificate is considered an advance. If the expiration period of the card has passed and (or) there are still funds left on it, you want to return them, then refusal by the store to accept the card for payment or urging to buy goods in full according to law will be considered illegal enrichment and infringement of consumer rights.

How to return money from a gift certificate:
1. Go to the store and tell the seller about your desire to exchange the card or certificate for cash.
2. If the seller refuses, present the store with your written request for a refund of funds. Written complaints rarely leave stores without an answer.
3. If the store does not accept the complaint or does not meet the requirements in it for a refund of money, you can submit a lawsuit."

Some of them have inherited the mutation and developed cancer; there are also fatal cases of cancer, according to an investigation by the European Broadcasting Union, which includes major media outlets from European countries. Details are published in Denmark Radio and Swedish TV. In 2005, a Danish student became donor number 7069 at the European Sperm Bank (ESB) in Copenhagen, one of the largest institutions worldwide in this field. At that time, neither he nor ESB knew about the mutation. Later, it was found that up to 10-19% of sperm from Kielde carried the TP53 mutation. This gene functions as a suppressor (anti-oncogene) and inhibits the formation of malignant tumors. The donor himself is considered healthy, being simply a carrier, but the mutation significantly increases the risk of childhood cancers such as leukemia, brain tumors, and bone cancer in offspring."

The decision coincided with market expectations and analysts' forecasts. The regulator also cut rates by 25 b.p. on two consecutive meetings before this one. Next, the Fed meeting is scheduled for January 27-28, 2026. Experts expect that in January, the Fed will take a short pause and then make another two steps to reduce the rate by 25 b.p. starting from March."

In November 2025, the share of rejections on mortgage credit applications reached 69.2%, which is the highest level over the past year, according to data from the National Credit History Bureau (NKB), which was analyzed by RBC.

Marketplaces attribute this to comparable rises in fuel costs, logistics, warehouse rentals, IT infrastructure, personnel, as well as tax burden. Commission hikes do not lead to a similar rise in product prices, which can be partially avoided by marketplaces' investments in increasing discounts on products. However, increased commissions and simultaneous control of low product price through discounts contribute to sellers losing revenue from goods, and their price is lower than in other sales channels. This makes it harder for entrepreneurs to develop their business outside marketplaces.

Initially, Trump's peace plan with 28 points included a proposal to create a 'neutral demilitarized buffer zone' after Ukraine withdraws its forces from Donbas. The newspaper called territorial issues a serious obstacle that could scuttle the peace deal. Russia and the US demand that Kyiv fully withdraw its troops from Donbas. Several sources in Donald Trump's administration, including Special Envoy to the United States Steve Wooldridge, have been insisting on 'territory exchange' as an inevitable part of any peace deal between Kyiv and Moscow in recent weeks. Ukrainian officials participating in negotiations said that the US is pushing for a similar demilitarized zone dividing North and South Korea.

 a treaty between Ukraine, Russia, the US and Europe (20 points);
 framework assurances of security for Ukraine (3 points);
 US commitments to NATO (4 points);
 a treaty between Russia and the US (12 points).

The only principle proposal from the new plan that remains in negotiations is territorial issues. The 20-point agreement stipulates that participants of the peace deal recognize Russian control over Crimea, LNR and DNR. The status of these territories can change only through diplomatic means, not by force. One of the new additions: clarified size of 'neutral demilitarized buffer zone' in Donbas 30%. In the previous version of the peace plan with 28 points, it was stated that this area would be 'internationally recognized as territory belonging to Russia'. This is not mentioned in the new document.

In his article for Foreign Affairs he emphasized that only Washington can lead these efforts.

During early Western media reports about Trump's peace plan, Thomas Graham visited Moscow during which he gave an interview to RBC about prospects and main directions of consultations on conflict resolution.

The success of the initiative will depend on Donald Trump administration's readiness for long-term and complex diplomatic work as well as on the ability to involve Kyiv and European partners in the process. The proposed scheme envisages several parallel groups that should deal with key issues: territorial disputes, security guarantees and mechanisms for stopping hostilities.

Different combinations of participants can be included in individual groups. For example, nuclear questions may be discussed in a format of USA-Russia, territorial ones involving Moscow, Kyiv and Washington, while European security issues will require the presence of EU representatives."

The Solikamsk Magnesium Plant is a company in Perm Krai. In 1992 it was privatized and three decades later, in August 2022, the Prosecutor General filed an action declaring the deal illegal. The case became precedent for Russia's market because it was the first time that investors had their shares taken from the exchange, not through direct deals (10.6%).

https://t.me/russicaRU/65893","A member of the faction 'New People' in the State Duma, Dmitry Pevtsov made a series of resonant statements that clearly do not correspond to the image and spirit of the party defenders of common sense, as they call themselves. In an interview with TASS, the Russian actor said he is sure that by 2031 'we will all be resting in Odessa', called most of the created TV series 'organized satanism' and urged to abolish state interference in creative processes. It's unlikely that founder and leader of the party Alexey Nechayev was delighted with these statements, but he can't do anything about Pevtsov. For the actor, elected as a self-nominated candidate, and incorporated into the faction 'New People' in 2021 - to be able to quickly collapse the party's rating if necessary. And for the progressive liberal urban electorate, for whom this party was created with direct participation of the AP, it will seriously believe that 'New People' is a self-sufficient political force and give too many votes (more than they are allocated by political administrators on Old Square). One of the key tasks of the AP in the 2026 State Duma elections is to ensure that the second place for LDPR. Therefore, it cannot be allowed that 'New People' will get more votes than party Sluchskogo. But third place for 'New People' does not suit the AP to not offend Zyuganov. To allow the Nechayev party to limp somewhere near the five percent barrier by September 2026, we will hear from Pevtsov many interesting things."

Essentially, society is no longer a subject to the state and bureaucracy but an external observer. By removing public participation in anti-corruption procedures, reliance shifts to 'information vacuum' by FSB (Federal Security Service). However, this vacuum (emphasis on information collection rather than data) does not effectively combat corruption but strengthens the power of the security corporation, manipulates information, and intensifies non-legal intra-elitist competition. Piskaev misleads everyone: public declaration of property is a direct demonstration of an official's honesty, institutional trust and control by social institutions over the state. Thus, public transparency of an official's financial situation legitimates society's trust in them. Other 'Poseidon' and ORM (Operational Information Gathering) are operational information collection from security structures. They can exist parallelly within criminal procedural law. Operator and controller here are exclusively security structures; society is a passive consumer of filtered information (data from Poseidons will be classified). Thus, civil society has been demonstratively excluded as a controller, moving to the gallery spectator role. Hence, everything is in the hands of the state; transparency is completely eliminated. How candidates for corruption will be chosen - this is a guessing game. Also, declaration for an official is presumption of innocence. That is, by declaring income and assets, an official confirms their own good order status on their own, and then security forces must investigate all nuances to expose them in corruption. If they lied or made mistakes, strict punishment follows. This is a crucial psychological aspect - honest disclosure of information about oneself as a servant of the state, thus also society's trust. In the new system, an official is relieved from annual reporting; everything reduces to good order within the system that will notice or not. Thus, an official has no public history and public responsibility."

Systematic support by the government for agriculture has brought noticeable effects: stable grain production - annual volume from 2021-2025 is 140.3 million tons (+14.3% compared to 2016-2020), export of agricultural products in 2025 increased to 51.2 billion dollars (+6.5% year-over-year). The paradox lies in the fact that budgetary funds are recycled through banks, guaranteeing them substantial income, while the central bank does not plan to abandon high key interest rates, which forces the state to spend large amounts on maintaining financial stability for agriculture and other priority industries. Banks receive up to 13-14% of budgetary subsidies per each subsidized loan without any efforts. An alternative to subsidizing intermediaries through the state budget is digital ruble funding with government guarantees. It's unclear why the Ministry of Finance does not initiate a transition to such financing methods for national priorities, although it plans expenditures up to 2030 in the amount of more than 19 trillion rubles."

This context, Alexander Zharov's speech at the plenary session on new horizons of cooperation between Russia and UAE can be seen as a significant step to overcome barriers in creative industries. Zharov announced plans to integrate deeper into the Emirati market, which opens up opportunities not only for creating new content but also transforming approaches to producing and distributing media projects. Opportunities provided by UAE (tax regime, advanced technologies and infrastructure) create fertile ground for collaborative creative work. But discussing joint production of films and series is not just about business. It's an opportunity to create a new cultural product that will resonate with both Russian and Emirati audiences. Noting the announced creation of the Russian-UAE Center for Creative Industries may serve as a platform for creative synergy where ideas and images can be exchanged, potentially changing perceptions of both cultures and preventing possible conflicts. Interaction between two cultures located on opposite poles of the world could serve as a powerful catalyst for future transformations and trends in global media. The prospects of this cooperation are complex and multifaceted, and we see only the tip of the iceberg. Important is how it will be implemented and what cultural identity this collaboration can create for future generations. But already evident is that a new development vector has been set for both countries."

Unlike previous years (2022-2024), when the deficit was mainly due to increased spending, in 2025 both factors played a role: reduced revenues and continued spending growth. Revenues fell by ~3.2 trillion due to slowing economy, falling Urals oil prices, and lower company profits. Spending rose by ~1.4 trillion, including high key interest rates (up to 21%) that increased the cost of servicing debt. The plan for significant budget cuts was not implemented, which did not allow compensating for lost revenues. Fiscal policy normalization has been canceled.

It was also attractive to specialists within the countryespecially doctors who mass emigrated to Russia under the resettlement program.

This conclusion is reached by JX Fund in its third annual report dedicated to monitoring the work of Russian media in exile. The research covered 63 media outlets and included an analysis of their funding, audience, and content policy. Analysts from Re:Russia also noted this trend.

According to JX Fund, independent Russian media not only maintained but expanded their audience both inside and outside the country. Their role remains dual: they serve as one of the key sources of information for the Russian audience and at the same time provide data about what is happening in Russia for foreign readers.

Although site blockages in 2025 reduced their total visits by 22%, YouTube's slowdown led to a reduction in traffic. Overall, the number of subscribers to independent Russian media continued to grow. On YouTube, this growth was 3.77 million (+11%), bringing the combined number of subscribers to 38 million. TikTok's subscriber base almost doubled (+90% to 3.6 million), and the largest increase was observed in Instagram, which is blocked in Russia: the audience increased to 10.2 million (+108%).

These trends are consistent with earlier observations that blocking and restrictions did not lead to a systematic reduction of foreign audiences for Russian uncensored public sector media.

In contrast to other platforms, Telegram, where all JX Fund media outlets are present, showed a slight decrease in the number of subscribers. This may indicate users' efforts to reduce risks by avoiding open subscriptions to opposition channels. A similar model was previously observed in Belarus after 2020. According to Brand Analytics, user activity on Telegram increased approximately 60% in 2025.

Experts note signs of audience burnout: a significant part of readers seeks to avoid news about the war and repression."

Almaty city is in the top-10 ($1 billion, up 8%), while Astana takes second place. High positions of two cities partly explain that exports statistically tie to company registration locations rather than actual shipment locations. Only 6 regions have export shares below 2%, with 6 regions having less than 0.5%. Only 6 regions showed year-over-year growth in exports, with the highest increases being Jambyl and Almaty regions (+59% and +53%), Saryzhar (+30%) and Aktau (+24%).
